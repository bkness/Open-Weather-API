This is a weather dshboard I created using third party apis. With the following weather dashboard I used bootstrap to create a comprehensive layout using the collum and row techniques directly into my html. I gave all of my html an organized layout by assigning classes and id's that I can call on withh css and javascript functionality. When a user searches or presses any of theb city buttons, then a current forecast and 5 day forecast are presented to the user. 

Here is a screenshot of the app
